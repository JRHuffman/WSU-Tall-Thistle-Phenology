# WSU-Tall-Thistle-Phenology

This is a project involving the development of tall thistles across their reproductive lifespan, analyzing how the effects of herbivory and fertilization affect developmental timings. Here, you'll find three R/R-Markdown-scripts:

1. Phenology - 2022: This is data I personally collected across the Summer of 2022, having collected more thorough information on flowerhead production and stages than the multi-year dataset.
2. Phenology - 2018-2022: This is the multi-year data collected using the same technique, evaluating how different years could have different results.
3. Climate Data: Multi-year data is difficult with even five years of data collection as climatic events like drought or increased rainfall can have drastically different effects on how tall thistles react to herbivory and fertilization.

This work could not have been done without the aid and supervision of Dr. Leland Russell at Wichita State University.
